## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a cloud developer specializing in building scalable, event-driven serverless applications using AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway. This project demonstrates how to architect cloud-native solutions that are not only highly performant and resilient, but also cost-efficient and secure.

At the core of this application is an event-driven architecture powered by AWS services. Lambda functions serve as the compute layer, automatically triggered by events such as HTTP requests via API Gateway, message queues (SQS), database changes (DynamoDB Streams), or file uploads (S3). This approach eliminates the need for always-on servers, enabling applications to scale seamlessly based on demand while keeping operational overhead to a minimum.

This repository also showcases cost-optimized serverless workflows, designed to make the most of AWS's pay-as-you-go model. Functions are kept lightweight and modular, ensuring faster execution times and reduced resource consumption. By integrating services like Step Functions, DynamoDB, and SNS, the architecture supports complex workflows and asynchronous processing without compromising on efficiency or reliability.

Security is a key priority throughout the design. IAM roles follow the principle of least privilege, API Gateway routes are protected with Cognito or Lambda authorizers, and all data transmission is encrypted. Logging and monitoring via CloudWatch provide full visibility into system performance, while structured logs and custom metrics enable proactive debugging and alerting.

Whether you're building a microservices-based backend, an event-driven API, or a fully serverless web application, this repository offers a practical, real-world example of how to use AWS Lambda and API Gateway to deliver production-grade solutions.
